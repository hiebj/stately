# stately

**[stately-react](/stately-react)** `v0.0.6`

**[stately-async](/stately-async)** `v0.2.1`  
Functional tools for managing the state of asynchronous operations

## APIs
This project uses [TypeDoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc), which generates API documentation from TypeScript types and JSDoc. Each module generates its own API docs. [At some point](https://howmanydaystill.com/its/heat-death-of-the-universe), I'll host the TypeDoc on GitHub pages; for now, you have to run it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/hiebj/stately.git
cd stately/[submodule-name]
npm install
npm build
npm docs
```

This will host a static TypeDoc site at `8080`.
